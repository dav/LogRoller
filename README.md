# LogRoller

LogRoller is a macOS app and CLI for collecting and analyzing structured test logs from devices on your local network.

It was initially built to give coding agents a skill that could access event logs from under-develop code running on local test devices. This allows the agents to examine how the code being produced is behaving in manual test runs.

## What It Does

- Runs a local HTTPS ingest server for log events.
- Stores and organizes logs by run and device.
- Provides desktop browsing/filtering for collected logs.
- Exposes a CLI designed for automation and AI-agent workflows.
- Includes a ready-made Skill file
